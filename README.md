# alexa-trends-finder
Gather insights from the Alexa analytics website to see what is trending.

This is the root [Alexa webpage](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top) that this script can crawl within.



#### So why was this made?

Being a inquisitive person and in college, I had to figure out what topics were trending in 

different domains like Science, Religion, Technology and set my future goals based on the insights 

gathered. But however there was a roadblock that I met, which was the costly API interface which Amazon 

offered. So to find a solution for that I created this script.



#### So What does this do?

For a given copied url of a certain topic like, let's say Science
It will give the below results.

and the in depth version.

git clone https://github.com/soulbliss/alexa-trends-finder.git
cd alexa-trends-finder
pip install requirements.txt
cd alexa-trends-finder
python3 core.py --help
```
